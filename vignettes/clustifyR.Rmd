## Why use `clustifyr`?

Single cell transcriptomes are difficult to annotate without extensive knowledge of the underlying biology of the system in question. Even with this knowledge, accurate identification can be challenging due to the lack of detectable expression of common marker genes defined by bulk RNA-seq, flow cytometry, other single cell RNA-seq platforms, etc.

`clustifyr` solves this problem by providing functions to automatically annotate single cells or clusters using bulk RNA-seq data or marker gene lists (ranked or unranked). Additional functions allow for exploratory analysis of calculated similarities between single cell RNA-seq datasets and reference data.

## A simple example: 10x Genomics PBMCs

In this example, we take a 10x Genomics 3' scRNA-seq dataset from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and annotate the cell clusters (identified using `Seurat`) using bulk RNA-seq data from isolated PBMC cell populations. The cell types in this dataset have been previously annotated, so this is a good dataset to use for testing the accuracy of `clustifyr`.

To identify cell types, the `clustifyr()` function requires several inputs:

* A matrix of normalized single-cell RNA-seq counts
* A meta.data table containing the cluster assignments for each cell
* A matrix containing bulk RNA-seq data for each cell type of interest
* A list of genes to use for comparison (optional)

Using the `plot_tsne()` function, we can plot the known identities of each cluster, which were stored in the "classified" column of the meta.data table.

```{r "Load data", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 10}
library(clustifyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

# Matrix of normalized single-cell RNA-seq counts
full_pbmc4k_matrix <- clustifyrdata::pbmc4k_matrix

# meta.data table containing cluster assignments for each cell 
# The table that we are using also contains the known cell identities in the "classified" column
full_pbmc4k_meta <- clustifyrdata::pbmc4k_meta

# Create tSNE showing known cell identities for each cluster
plot_tsne(
  data = full_pbmc4k_meta,  # meta.data table containing UMAP or tSNE data
  feature = "classified",   # name of column in meta.data to color cells by
  do_label = TRUE,          # should the feature label be shown on each cluster?
  do_legend = FALSE         # should the legend be shown?
)
```

## Calculate correlation coefficients

`clustifyr` provides the `clustify()` function, which takes as input a matrix of single cell RNA-seq expression values, a metadata table with cluster assignments, and a matrix with bulk RNA seq datasets. 

```{r "Run clustifyr()"}
# Calculate correlation coefficients for each cluster (pearson by default)
res <- clustify(
  input = full_pbmc4k_matrix,     # matrix of normalized single-cell RNA-seq counts
  metadata = full_pbmc4k_meta,    # meta.data table containing cell clusters
  ref_mat = pbmc_bulk_matrix,     # matrix containing bulk RNA-seq data for each cell type
  query_genes = pbmc4k_vargenes,  # list of highly varible genes identified with Seurat
  cluster_col = "cluster"         # name of column in meta.data containing cell clusters
)

# Tidy up column names
colnames(res) <- gsub("primary human ", "", colnames(res))

# Peek at correlation matrix
res[1:5, 1:5]
```

To visualize the `clustifyr()` results we can use the `plot_cor_heatmap()` function to plot the correlation coefficients for each cluster and each cell type.

```{r "Create correlation heatmap", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
# Create heatmap of correlation coefficients
plot_cor_heatmap(
  cor_matrix = res  # matrix of correlation coefficients from clustifyr()
)
```

## Plot cluster identities and correlation coefficients

`clustifyr` provides functions to plot single cells using pre-calculated tSNE embeddings (or those from any other dimensionality reduction method), and to plot correlation coefficients on those projections. The plots below show that the highest correlations between these bulk RNA-seq data and the test scRNA-seq dataset are restricted to the correct cell clusters.

```{r "Overlay corr coefficients on UMAP", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 12}
# Overlay correlation coefficients on UMAPs for the first two cell types
plot_cor(
  cor_matrix = res,                   # matrix of correlation coefficients from clustifyr()
  metadata = full_pbmc4k_meta,        # meta.data table containing UMAP or tSNE data
  data_to_plot = colnames(res)[1:2],  # name of cell type(s) to plot correlation coefficients
  cluster_col = "cluster"             # name of column in meta.data containing cell clusters
)
```

The `plot_best_call()` function can be used to label each cluster with the cell type that gives the highest corelation coefficient. The plots below show that the highest correlations between the bulk RNA-seq data and the 10x Genomics scRNA-seq dataset are restricted to the correct cell clusters.

```{r "Label clusters", fig.height = 5.5, fig.width = 12}
# Label clusters with clustifyr cell identities
clustifyr_types <- plot_best_call(
  cor_matrix = res,             # matrix of correlation coefficients from clustifyr()
  metadata = full_pbmc4k_meta,  # meta.data table containing UMAP or tSNE data
  do_label = TRUE,              # should the feature label be shown on each cluster?
  do_legend = FALSE             # should the legend be shown?
) +
  ggtitle("clustifyr cell types")

# Compare clustifyr results with known cell identities
known_types <- plot_tsne(
  data = full_pbmc4k_meta,  # meta.data table containing UMAP or tSNE data
  feature = "classified",   # name of column in meta.data to color clusters by
  do_label = TRUE,          # should the feature label be shown on each cluster?
  do_legend = FALSE         # should the legend be shown?
) +
  ggtitle("Known cell types")

plot_grid(known_types, clustifyr_types)
```

## Calculate correlation coefficients on a per cell basis

Correlation coefficients can also be calculated on a per cell basis by setting `per_cell = TRUE`.

```{r "Per cell clustifyr", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 12}
# Calculate correlation coefficients for each cell
cell_res <- clustify(
  input = full_pbmc4k_matrix,     # matrix of normalized single-cell RNA-seq counts
  ref_mat = pbmc_bulk_matrix,     # matrix containing bulk RNA-seq data for each cell type
  query_genes = pbmc4k_vargenes,  # list of highly varible genes identified with Seurat
  per_cell = TRUE
)

# Overlay correlation coefficients on UMAPs
plot_cor(
  cor_matrix = cell_res,                      # matrix of correlation coefficients from clustifyr()
  metadata = full_pbmc4k_meta,                # meta.data table containing UMAP or tSNE data
  data_to_plot = colnames(cell_res)[c(1, 5)]  # name of cell type(s) to plot correlation coefficient
)
```

## Classify cells using known marker genes

The `clustify_lists()` function allows cell types to be assigned based on known marker genes. This function requires a table containing markers for each cell type of interest. Cell types can be assigned using several different statistical tests including, hypergeometric, Jaccard, Spearman, and GSEA.

```{r "clustifyr with gene lists", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6}

# Take a peek at marker gene table
cbmc_m

# Available metrics include: "hyper", "jaccard", "spearman", "gsea"
list_res <- clustify_lists(
  input = full_pbmc4k_matrix,       # matrix of normalized single-cell RNA-seq counts
  cluster_info = full_pbmc4k_meta,  # meta.data table containing cell clusters
  cluster_col = "cluster",          # name of column in meta.data containing cell clusters
  marker = cbmc_m,                  # list of known marker genes
  metric = "hyper"                  # test to use for assigning cell types
)

# view as heatmap, or plot_best_call
plot_cor_heatmap(
  cor_matrix = list_res,         # matrix of correlation coefficients from clustify_lists()
  col = not_pretty_palette,      # colors to use for heatmap
  cluster_rows = FALSE,          # cluster by row?
  cluster_columns = FALSE,       # cluster by column?
  legend_title = "-log10(padj)"  # title of heatmap legend
)

```

## Direct handling of `seurat` v2 and v3 objects

`clustifyr()` can also use a `Seurat` object as input and return a new `Seurat` object with the cell types added as a column in the meta.data. 

```{r include = F}
# clustifyr can even returning a new object with "type" added to the meta.data.
res <- clustify(
  input = s_small,
  cluster_col = "res.1",
  ref_mat = pbmc_bulk_matrix,
  seurat_out = T
)

# or return a correlation matrix
res <- clustify_lists(
  input = s_small,
  per_cell = F,
  marker = pbmc4k_markers,
  marker_inmatrix = F,
  cluster_col = "res.1",
  seurat_out = F
)

# or return a combined ref matrix with marker info
res <- clustify_nudge(
  input = s_small,
  ref_mat = cbmc_ref,
  marker = cbmc_m,
  cluster_col = "res.1",
  threshold = 0.8,
  seurat_out = F
)
```
