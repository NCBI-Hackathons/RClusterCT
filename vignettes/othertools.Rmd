Some comments on using `clustifyR` with other scRNA-seq analysis-augmenting packages

## Feature selection
Using all genes works moderately well, but performance is improved in various testing scenarios by some form of feature selection, such as var.genes in `seurat`, or `M3Drop`.

## Imputation
Imputation methods such as `ALRA`, in attempt to fill in drop-out signal, are not necessary for per-cluster identity assignment. Per-cell assignment is somewhat improved with imputation.

## Variance stabilizing transformation
`clustifyR` operates on raw counts and log transformed data. VST, such as implemented by `sctransform` is acceptable, but does not appear to give additional benefits.

## Background signal removal
Massive cell death can potentially lead to RNA contamination of all cells sequenced. Assessment of background contamination, and mitigation actions if needed, is important.

## Marker gene list selection
Marker genes generated by `seurat` and other methods can be converted to gene list matrix form for `clustify_list`. Somewhat differently, `clustify_nudge` works best with normal feature selection plus a short and nonoverlapping list of markers. Both approaches are handled by settings in `matrixize_markers`.
