## Motivation

Clustering is a crucial step in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Most methods examine the inherent structure of the scRNA-seq dataset, without making use of the biological information of each cluster. Consequently, optimal determination of the number of clusters and interpretation of each cluster become a challenging problem. Here, we implement the clustering function refine_clusters, which accounts for both the proximality of expression profiles within a cluster and the similarity of each cell to the reference bulk RNA-seq datasets of purified cell types.

## Theory

Function refine_clusters comp a cell with expression profile $\vec{x}$ to

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
