\usage{
build_atlas(matrix_fns, genes_fn, output_fn = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_fns}{character vector of paths to study matrices stored as .rds files.
If a named character vector, then the name will be added as a suffix to the cell type
name in the final matrix. If it is not named, then the filename will be used (without .rds)}

\item{genes_fn}{text file with a single column containing genes and the ordering desired
in the output matrix}

\item{output_fn}{output filename for .rds file. If NULL the matrix will be returned instead of
saving}
}
\value{
Combined matrix with all genes given
}
