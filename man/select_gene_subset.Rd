\title{Pick and sort genes}
\usage{
select_gene_subset(bin_mat, gene_constraints)
}
\arguments{
\item{bin_mat}{Expression matrix with row names as the gene names. Use short name for now}

\item{gene_constraints}{A list of vectors, where each vector is a candidate list of selected genes.}
}
\description{
Data set from different sources may contain different gene sets.
In order to establish a fair comparison, we select a subset of genes shared by both datasets.
This function can be also used to extract data for genes of interest, such as highly variable genes.
Possible examples of candidate lists include row names of expression matrix and a list of highly variable genes.
